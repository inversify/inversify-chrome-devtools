### Setup
You can connect your InversifyJS `Kernel` instances to the DevTools using the `__inversifyDevtools__` global function: 

```ts
/// <reference path="node_modules/inversify-dts/inversify/inversify.d.ts"/>

import { Kernel } from "inversify";

let kernel = new Kernel();

let win: any = window;

if (win.__inversifyDevtools__) {
    win.__inversifyDevtools__(kernel);
}
```

The `__inversifyDevtools__` global function is only available if the chrome extension has been installed.
